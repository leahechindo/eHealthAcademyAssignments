    <h3 id="the-web-and-terms">Understanding the Web and its Terms</h3>
    <p>
      I am new to the world of web development and a month ago, I had no idea what to do or how to go about it.<br> The first thing I was taught on the elearning platform was how the web works (the behind the scenes of what a browser presnts). <br>I loved the classes and how it was so easy to understand, I have never really thought of being a web developer and this is still quite exciting for me. <br> some of the things I learnt the first time was what programming languages are, how they work and how they affect the browser display for a user. <br> I now have a better understanding of the processes involved in web design and development and I am looking forward to what's to come.

    </p>

    <h3 id="learning">Learning HTML and CSS tags</h3>
    <p>
      I am now working on tags. <br> It's trickier than learning terms and definitions but definitely worth it. <br> There is a plethora of tags in HTML and CSS and it gets confusing sometimes but I suppose its all part of the learning process. <br> I love how I'm making progress, I designed a travel webpage, not the best but a good start. <br> then a recipe book page (that I'm actually quite impressed with myself on). I know that I'll get better and better and knowing that is even more exciting. <br> I am looking forward to new projects.
