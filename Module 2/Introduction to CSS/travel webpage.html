    <h1><strong> AN ESCAPE FROM CIVILIZATION - <em> The Acklins and Crooked Island</em></strong></h1>
    <p id="brief-island-history">
      Known as two of the more remote islands, Acklins & Crooked Island are almost as natural as they were when The Bahamas was first discovered. Separated by a 500-square-mile lagoon known as the Bight of Acklins, both islands are a haven for boating, bonefishing, snorkeling and diving. You’ll also find miles of undisturbed sandy beaches, coral gardens, limestone caves, magnificent cliffs, and even remnants of slave and cotton plantations. It’s the perfect way to forget about the complexities of life. In short, Acklins & Crooked Island are The Bahamas’ definition of seclusion.

    <h2><em>SECLUSIONS</em></h2>
    <p>
      The islands in this atoll — Acklins, Crooked Island, Long Cay — are unspoiled, sparsely populated, and mostly undisturbed since Christopher Columbus stopped by. A visit here provides a perfectly secluded getaway.
